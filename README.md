Minecraft ID Resolver

The Minecraft Web-based ID Resolver is a website where you upload a zip archive containing your configs, the server will scan them for id's and display an overview.

You can then lock id's you do not want to be changed or used.

The server will then assign new id's to any non-locked item without using locked id's, then provide a download link to a new archive with the modified configs.
